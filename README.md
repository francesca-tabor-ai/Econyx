# Econyx

Econyx is the world's first Economic Control Plane for Multi-Agent Systems (MAS).

While the previous decade of AI focused on raw capability and accuracy, Econyx is designed for the era of autonomous production—where AI is no longer a research project, but a line item on the balance sheet. It provides the essential infrastructure to design, deploy, and govern agentic workflows where every decision is filtered through the lens of unit economics, margin targets, and business value.

## The Economic Layer for Autonomous Systems

Econyx sits at the intersection of AI Infrastructure, FinOps, and Enterprise Workflow Orchestration. It transforms "black box" agent spend into a predictable, high-margin asset through four core pillars:

- **MAS Unit Economics Engine**: Real-time telemetry that attributes every token, tool call, and reasoning step to specific workflows, customers, and business outcomes.
- **Cost-Aware Agent Planning**: A cognitive middleware that empowers agents to autonomously select the most cost-effective path (e.g., model routing from Pro to Flash) without sacrificing SLAs.
- **Self-Throttling Governance**: Protective runtime guardrails that automatically slow or defer low-value tasks during compute price spikes or budget proximity.
- **Enterprise Workspace & Billing**: A robust management layer for global teams to handle multi-workspace isolation, seat-based entitlements, and complex integration mappings (CRM, Data Warehouses, DevTools).

## Platform Capabilities

- **Predictive Forecasting**: Simulate MAS costs and token price sensitivity before deployment using advanced ML models.
- **Pareto-Optimal Negotiation**: Autonomous bargaining protocols where agents trade resources and compute to maximize system-wide surplus.
- **Economic Guardrails**: Hardened security and spending primitives that block "runaway agents" and prevent leakage through real-time enforcement policies.
- **Marketplace & Internal Economy**: A discovery layer for specialized agent capabilities, complete with dynamic pricing and transaction auditing.

## Enterprise Value

- **For the CFO**: Predictable AI spend with transparent ROI per automation.
- **For the CTO**: Model-agnostic orchestration and automated technical debt reduction through self-optimizing logic.
- **For Product Teams**: The ability to build and scale outcome-based pricing models that are natively aware of underlying compute costs.

Econyx is the invisible infrastructure that makes autonomous digital labor commercially viable at enterprise scale. It is the financial operating system for the age of autonomous work.
